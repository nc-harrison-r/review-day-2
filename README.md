# Data, Backend, and Cloud Review

This exercise is intended to test your understanding of SQL,
servers, and cloud deployments.

In each section, you will find instructions on how to proceed. Make
sure to commit and push your work frequently.

Remember to submit your work with the slack command `/nchelp review` at the end of each section!

**You should use a separate virtual environment for each section**

It is _not_ expected that you should finish all the material in each section
(but please try!). As a guide, you should spend no more than:

- one and a half hours on the **data** section
- two hours on the **server** section
- three hours on the **cloud** section

In each case, the quality of what you do is more important than the quantity,
but try to get as much done as you can.

Please complete the sections in the given order.

Good luck!
